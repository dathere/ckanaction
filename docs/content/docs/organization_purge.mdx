          <Callout title="Warning!" type="warn">Purging an organization cannot
          be undone!</Callout>


          Purging an organization completely removes the organization from the
          CKAN database, whereas deleting a organization simply marks the
          organization as deleted (it will no longer show up in the frontend,
          but is still in the db).


          Datasets owned by the organization will remain, just not in an
          organization anymore.


          You must be authorized to purge the organization.
