          Creates the default views (if necessary) on the provided resource


          The function will get the plugins for the default views defined in the
          configuration, and if some were found the `can_view` method of each
          one of them will be called to determine if a resource view should be
          created. Resource views extensions get the resource dict and the
          parent dataset dict.


          If the latter is not provided, `package_show` is called to get it.


          By default only view plugins that don't require the resource data to
          be in the DataStore are called. See
          `ckan.logic.action.create.package_create_default_resource_views()` for
          details on the `create_datastore_views` parameter.
