          Creates the default views on all resources of the provided dataset


          By default only view plugins that don't require the resource data to
          be in the DataStore are called. Passing `create_datastore_views` as
          `True` will only create views that require data to be in the
          DataStore. The first case happens when the function is called from
          `package_create` or `package_update`, the second when it's called from
          the DataPusher when data was uploaded to the DataStore.
