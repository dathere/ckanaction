          undone!</Callout>


          Purging a dataset completely removes the dataset from the CKAN
          database, whereas deleting a dataset simply marks the dataset as
          deleted (it will no longer show up in the front-end, but is still in
          the db).


          You must be authorized to purge the dataset.
