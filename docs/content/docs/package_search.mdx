          Searches for packages satisfying a given search criteria.


          This action accepts Solr search query parameters (details below), and
          returns a dictionary of results, including dictized datasets that
          match the search criteria, a search count, and also facet information.


          Solr Parameters:


          For more in depth treatment of each parameter, please read the [Solr
          Documentation](https://solr.apache.org/guide/6_6/common-query-parameters.html).


          This action accepts a subset of Solr's search query parameters.


          The following advanced Solr parameters are supported as well. Note
          that some of these are only available on particular Solr versions. See
          Solr’s dismax and edismax documentation for further details on them:


          `qf`, `wt`, `bf`, `boost`, `tie`, `defType`, `mm`


          Examples:


          - `q=flood` datasets containing the word *flood*, *floods*, or
          *flooding*

          - `fq=tags:economy` datasets with the tag *economy*

          - `facet.field=["tags"] facet.limit=10 rows=0` top 10 tags


          <Callout title="Title" type="error">

          There is an issue for the Body dropdown within this UI where an empty
          object `{}` is set for the `facet` field.


          Please either remove this field by clicking "Open JSON editor" in the
          Body dropdown or set it to `true` (the default value) or `false`.
