          Allows to modify some CKAN runtime-editable config options


          It takes arbitrary key, value pairs and checks the keys against the
          config options update schema. If some of the provided keys are not
          present in the schema a `ValidationError` is raised. The values are
          then validated against the schema, and if validation is passed, for
          each key, value config option:


          - It is stored on the `system_info` database table

          - The Pylons `config` object is updated.

          - The `app_globals` (`g`) object is updated (this only happens for
          options explicitly defined in the `app_globals` module.
