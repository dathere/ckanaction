          Return the organizations that the user has a given permission for.


          Specifically it returns the list of organizations that the currently
          authorized user has a given permission (for example: "manage_group")
          against.


          By default this returns the list of organizations that the currently
          authorized user is member of, in any capacity.


          When a user becomes a member of an organization in CKAN they're given
          a "capacity" (sometimes called a "role"), for example "member",
          "editor" or "admin".


          Each of these roles has certain permissions associated with it. For
          example the admin role has the "admin" permission (which means they
          have permission to do anything). The editor role has permissions like
          "create_dataset", "update_dataset" and "delete_dataset". The member
          role has the "read" permission.


          This function returns the list of organizations that the authorized
          user has a given permission for. For example the list of organizations
          that the user is an admin of, or the list of organizations that the
          user can create datasets in. This takes account of when permissions
          cascade down an organization hierarchy.
