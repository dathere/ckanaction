          Patch a dataset (package).


          The difference between the update and patch methods is that the patch
          will perform an update of the provided parameters, while leaving all
          other parameters unchanged, whereas the update methods deletes all
          parameters not explicitly provided in the data_dict.


          To partially update resources or other metadata not at the top level
          of a package use `package_revise()` instead to maintain existing
          nested values.


          You must be authorized to edit the dataset and the groups that it
          belongs to.
