          Make a user a collaborator in a dataset.


          If the user is already a collaborator in the dataset then their
          capacity will be updated.


          Currently you must be an Admin on the dataset owner organization to
          manage collaborators.


          Note: This action requires the collaborators feature to be enabled
          with the
